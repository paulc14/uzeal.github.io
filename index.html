     <h1>Merry X-Mas David!</h1>
     <h3>Thank you for everything! And for putting up with my antics over the years.</h3>
     <p>When you are ready, just send me your personal email address to transfer ownership of <em>uzeal.xyz</em> to you. If you want to use another service other than <a href="https://www.namecheap.com" target="new">Namecheap</a>, just let me know.</p>
     <p>This domain is good for 2 years and will come up for renewal in 2026.</p>
     <p>I know it's not uzeal[dot]com, as that was a tad bit out of my price range to get (back) for you. Hopefully you can put this to good use.</p>
     <p>Have fun!</p>
